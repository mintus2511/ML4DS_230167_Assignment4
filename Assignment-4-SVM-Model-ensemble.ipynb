        "# Assignment 4: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Model Ensembling {-}\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment aims at familiarizing you with training and testing Suppor Vector Machine (SVM) classification model, along with model ensembling methods. The dataset you will be working on is 'data-breast-cancer.csv'. It is composed of attributes to build a prediction model. You will have to do:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **(5 points) Coding tasks:** The following questions involve writing code to complete specific tasks.  \n",
        "    1.1 *(1 point)* Load the data-breast-cancer.csv dataset and perform basic data cleaning, analysis and visualization to have a deep understanding about the data. Identify and remove outliers if applicable.  \n",
        "    1.2 *(1 point)* Train and evaluate an SVM model. Use GridSearchCV to find the best parameters: kernel, C, and gamma values, for the SVM model. Details of the SVM parameters can be found at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html.  \n",
        "    1.3 *(1 point)* Train and evaluate four other classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest. Compare their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score with the SVM's performance.  \n",
        "    1.4 *(2 points)* Apply three ensemble learning techniques: Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking, to solve the problem. Compare their performance against each other as well as against individual models. Summarize your observations and draw conclusions based on the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **(5 points) Open discussion questions:** These discussion questions ask you to analyze and argue your points.  Feel free to include relevant code examples to strengthen your arguments.  \n",
        "    2.1 *(1 point)* How well did the SVM model perform compared to the other classifiers? Did it outperform them, or did another model work better?  \n",
        "    2.2 *(1 point)* How did tuning the C and gamma parameters affect the model’s performance? Did you observe any signs of overfitting or underfitting?  \n",
        "    2.3 *(1 point)* How could this breast cancer classification model be used in real-world healthcare applications? What challenges might arise in deployment?  \n",
        "    2.4 *(1 point)* Medical diagnosis models come with ethical responsibilities. What are potential risks of using an automated model for breast cancer detection?  \n",
        "    2.5 *(1 point)* What was the most insightful part of this assignment? If you could improve your classification result, what would you do differently?  \n",
